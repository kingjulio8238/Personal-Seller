# Social Darwin Gödel Machine: Open-Ended Evolution of Self-Improving Content Distribution Agents

## Overview

This document outlines a modified version of the Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM) system, adapted from the original codebase at [https://github.com/jennyzzt/dgm](https://github.com/jennyzzt/dgm). The core evolutionary self-evolving principles remain intact: the system iteratively proposes modifications to its own codebase, evaluates improvements empirically, and accepts changes that enhance performance. However, instead of a coding agent focused on software engineering tasks (evaluated via benchmarks like SWE-bench and Polyglot), we pivot to a **content distribution agent** that generates, posts, and optimizes content across multiple social media platforms. Learning is driven by Reinforcement Learning (RL), where rewards are derived from real-time engagements (e.g., likes, shares, retweets, views, comments, and click-through rates).

The agent uses RL to refine its strategies for content creation, scheduling, platform selection, and adaptation to audience preferences. Self-evolution occurs through code mutations generated by foundation models (e.g., via Anthropic's Claude API), with fitness measured by aggregated RL rewards over evaluation episodes. This creates an open-ended loop of improvement, where the agent not only learns better content strategies but also evolves its own RL architecture, prompting mechanisms, and integration tools for superior long-term performance.

Key differences from the original DGM:
- **Domain Shift**: From code generation and editing to content generation, distribution, and optimization.
- **Evaluation Mechanism**: Replace coding benchmarks with RL-based reward signals from social media interactions.
- **RL Integration**: Incorporate an RL framework (e.g., using libraries like Stable Baselines or custom implementations) to handle state-action-reward loops for content decisions.
- **Ethical and Safety Notes**: Emphasize responsible use to avoid spam, misinformation, or platform violations; include rate limiting and human oversight.

## System Architecture

The system follows the same outer loop as the original DGM:
1. **Proposal Phase**: A foundation model (e.g., Claude) analyzes the current agent codebase and proposes modifications to improve content distribution logic, RL components, or integration tools.
2. **Validation Phase**: The modified agent is tested in a simulated or real environment by distributing content to social platforms and collecting engagement rewards via RL episodes.
3. **Selection Phase**: If the modified agent achieves higher average rewards (fitness score) than the parent, the changes are accepted, and the process iterates.

### Key Components
- **Content Agent**: The core agent (analogous to `coding_agent.py`) that generates content (text, images, videos) using prompts and LLMs, selects platforms, schedules posts, and tracks engagements.
- **RL Module**: Integrated RL algorithm (e.g., PPO or DQN) where:
  - **State**: Current content features, platform stats, audience demographics, time of day.
  - **Actions**: Generate/post content variants, choose platforms (e.g., X/Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn), adjust timing or targeting.
  - **Rewards**: Weighted sum of engagements (e.g., +1 for like, +5 for share) normalized over time; negative rewards for low engagement or violations.
- **Social Media Integrations**: Tools for API interactions (e.g., Tweepy for X, Facebook Graph API, Instagram API) to post content and query analytics.
- **Evaluation Environment**: A mix of simulated (mock APIs for fast testing) and real social media postings; use historical data for offline RL pre-training.
- **Self-Evolution Loop**: Managed by an outer script (analogous to `DGM_outer.py`), using foundation models to mutate code and evaluate via RL reward accumulation.

## Setup

Adapt the original setup with additional dependencies for RL and social APIs:

```
# API keys (add to ~/.bashrc or .env)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='...'  # For Claude-based proposals
export OPENAI_API_KEY='...'     # Optional for alternative models
export TWITTER_API_KEY='...'    # And other keys for X/Twitter, Facebook, etc.

# Install dependencies
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # From original, plus additions below

# Additional for RL and social integrations
pip install gym stable-baselines3 tweepy facebook-sdk instagrapi  # Or equivalent libraries

# Optional: For content generation (if using images/videos)
pip install pillow moviepy

# Verify API access and rate limits for each platform
```

Ensure compliance with platform terms of service. Use sandbox accounts for testing to avoid bans.

## Running the System

```
python social_dgm_outer.py --platform-list "twitter,facebook,instagram" --rl-episodes 10 --content-theme "tech-news"
```

- Outputs saved in `output_social_dgm/`, including post logs, engagement metrics, RL training curves, and code evolution history.
- Parameters:
  - `--platform-list`: Comma-separated social platforms to target.
  - `--rl-episodes`: Number of RL episodes per evaluation (e.g., 10 posts/tests).
  - `--content-theme`: Initial prompt theme for content generation (evolves over time).

## Proposed File Structure

Adapt the original structure:
- `analysis/`: Scripts for plotting engagement trends, RL reward curves, and evolution analysis.
- `initial/`: Baseline engagement logs from the initial content agent.
- `social_integrations/`: API wrappers for platforms (e.g., `twitter_tool.py`, `facebook_tool.py`).
- `rl_components/`: RL models, environments, and reward functions.
- `prompts/`: Prompts for content generation and code mutation (tailored for social optimization).
- `tests/`: Unit tests for posting, reward calculation, and safety checks.
- `tools/`: Utilities for content creation (e.g., text summarizers, image generators).
- `content_agent.py`: Main implementation of the initial content distribution agent with RL.
- `social_dgm_outer.py`: Entry point for the evolutionary loop.

## Evaluation and Rewards

- **Fitness Metric**: Average episodic reward from RL runs, aggregated over multiple posts/content cycles.
- **RL Details**:
  - Use a custom Gym environment where each episode involves generating and posting content, waiting for engagements (e.g., poll APIs after 1-24 hours), and updating the policy.
  - Exploration-Exploitation: Start with random content variations, refine via policy gradients.
  - Offline RL: Pre-train on historical engagement datasets (e.g., public social media data).
- **Challenges**: Real-time delays in engagements; mitigate with hybrid sim/real evals and time-boxed waits.

## Safety and Ethical Considerations

**Warning**: This system involves automated posting to public platforms, risking spam, misinformation spread, or account suspensions. Always:
- Implement human review gates for posts.
- Adhere to platform APIs' rate limits and content policies.
- Avoid sensitive topics; focus on benign content.
- Monitor for unintended biases in RL learning.
- Executing evolved code carries risks—run in isolated environments (e.g., Docker sandboxes).

For logs and experiments, adapt the original Google Drive approach to store post IDs, engagement data, and evolution traces.

This spec can be implemented by forking the original repo and modifying the key files as described.
