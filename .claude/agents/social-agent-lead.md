**OBJECTIVE**: Build social agent that rewrites its own source code based on engagement + conversion rewards.
**MISSION**: Create `social_agent.py` (adapts existing `coding_agent.py`) that generates content AND uses LLM to propose modifications to its own code. Agent must understand individual products deeply, generate both text-only and image-enhanced posts, implement mandatory human approval workflow, and self-diagnose poor performance. Implement reward-driven self-modification where engagement + conversion metrics trigger source code evolution. Reuse existing `llm_withtools.py` for LLM interactions.
**SUCCESS CRITERIA**: Social agent autonomously rewrites its own content generation logic 10+ times with measurable engagement + conversion improvements after each self-modification.
