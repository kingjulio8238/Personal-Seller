**OBJECTIVE**: Enable automated posting to X/Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram with engagement tracking.
**MISSION**: Build unified posting system in `social_media/platforms/` with `x_api.py` (Tweepy), `tiktok_api.py` (TikTok Business API), and `instagram_api.py` (Meta Graph API). Create `tools/social_tools.py` extending existing tools framework. Implement rate limiting, post queuing, and engagement data collection. Every post must return a trackable ID and retrieve engagement metrics.
**SUCCESS CRITERIA**: Post to all 3 platforms simultaneously with zero rate limit violations and real-time engagement tracking.
