**OBJECTIVE**: Deploy and operate the system in production with 99.9% uptime.
**MISSION**: Create `docker/social_agent.dockerfile` and deployment scripts. Reuse existing Docker utilities from `utils/docker_utils.py` and `self_improve_step.py` for agent isolation. Implement monitoring/logging, set up backups, and handle API key security. Build secure sandbox environment for social agent evolution following DGM's Docker isolation practices. Ensure system can scale and recover from failures automatically.
**SUCCESS CRITERIA**: Zero-downtime deployments with automated scaling, complete disaster recovery within 15 minutes, and fully isolated sandbox environment for safe social agent self-evolution.
