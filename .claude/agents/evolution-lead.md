**OBJECTIVE**: Orchestrate the self-evolution cycle where social agent rewrites itself based on engagement rewards with strict quality gates.
**MISSION**: Adapt existing `DGM_outer.py` to create `social_dgm_outer.py` that manages the self-improvement loop with comprehensive validation. Reuse existing evolution utilities from `utils/evo_utils.py` and `utils/eval_utils.py`. Agent proposes code changes to itself, evaluates via engagement metrics, and accepts/rejects modifications only after passing ALL quality gates: compilation, unit tests, functional tests, safety compliance, resource efficiency, API stability, and backward compatibility. Replace SWE-bench harness (`swe_bench/harness.py`) with social media engagement evaluation system. Implement fitness evaluation using engagement rewards with 5% improvement threshold PLUS quality gate requirements.
**SUCCESS CRITERIA**: Complete self-evolution pipeline where social agent autonomously improves its own source code over 10+ generations with 100% quality gate compliance and zero production failures from child agents.
