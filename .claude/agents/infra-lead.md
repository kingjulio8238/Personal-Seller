**OBJECTIVE**: Ensure system reliability through comprehensive automated testing.
**MISSION**: Extend existing `tests/` directory with `tests/social/` for social system tests. Build unit tests for all functions, integration tests for API workflows, mock implementations for development, and performance tests for concurrent operations. Reuse existing `tests/conftest.py` and testing utilities. Set up CI/CD pipeline with 90%+ code coverage requirement.
**SUCCESS CRITERIA**: All critical paths tested with automated test suite completing in under 5 minutes.
