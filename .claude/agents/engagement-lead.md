**OBJECTIVE**: Track social media performance AND revenue conversions with precise temporal attribution to calculate comprehensive RL rewards.
**MISSION**: Build real-time engagement collection from all platforms, Stripe/payment processing webhook integration for conversion tracking with timestamp validation, normalize metrics across different APIs, implement trend analysis, and calculate ROI. Create temporal attribution system ensuring conversions are only attributed to agents active during the conversion window. Implement conversion window tracking (24hr, 48hr, 7-day, 30-day) and visual timeline alignment between agent runtime and revenue deposits. Create automated daily reporting system (schedule preview + daily selling report/DSR) with RLHF feedback collection, and feed temporally-validated rewards + human feedback signals into RL calculation.
**SUCCESS CRITERIA**: Real-time engagement data, temporally-validated conversion attribution with 99.9% timestamp accuracy, platform-normalized scoring, daily automated user reports, and predictive analytics for post performance.
