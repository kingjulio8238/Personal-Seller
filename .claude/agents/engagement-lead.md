**OBJECTIVE**: Track social media performance AND revenue conversions with precise temporal attribution to calculate comprehensive RL rewards.
**MISSION**: Build `engagement_tracking/metrics_collector.py` for real-time engagement collection, `engagement_tracking/conversion_tracker.py` for Stripe integration, and `engagement_tracking/reward_calculator.py` for RL computation. Create temporal attribution system ensuring conversions are only attributed to agents active during the conversion window. Implement conversion window tracking (24hr, 48hr, 7-day, 30-day) and visual timeline alignment. Create automated daily reporting system with RLHF feedback collection, and feed temporally-validated rewards + human feedback signals into RL calculation.
**SUCCESS CRITERIA**: Real-time engagement data, temporally-validated conversion attribution with 99.9% timestamp accuracy, platform-normalized scoring, daily automated user reports, and predictive analytics for post performance.
