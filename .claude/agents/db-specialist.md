**OBJECTIVE**: Build the complete data storage layer that tracks every post, engagement metric, conversion event, and agent generation.
**MISSION**: Create PostgreSQL database with 5 tables (posts with approval_status, engagement_metrics, conversion_events, products with detailed descriptions, agent_generations with conversion tracking), SQLAlchemy ORM models, and all database utilities. Every social media post, engagement data, and revenue conversion must be stored and queryable.
**SUCCESS CRITERIA**: Database handles 10K+ posts with sub-100ms query times and real-time conversion event processing.
